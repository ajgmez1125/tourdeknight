# What is this?
So obviously, without a deployment environment, there's no way for you (the user), to be able to see Tour De Knight's full functionality.

However! this small piece of documentation will act as a guide into what this application does when run.

### Ok, ok, ok, enough of that. Why isn't it deployed?
The deployment of this application is still a work in progress. Being a student (and a broke one at that), I am still working on not only learning the technologies involved
in application deployment in-depth but also finding the funds for server space.

Some solutions I thought of as of now was
* AWS EC2
* Heroku
* Somehow running it locally?

However, I will run you through this application's main functionalities.
