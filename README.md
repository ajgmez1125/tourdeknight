# Disclaimer
So obviously, without a deployment environment, there's no way for you (the user), to be able to see Tour De Knight's full functionality.

However! this small piece of documentation will act as a guide into what this application does when it runs.

# What is this?
Tour De Knight is a simple application I made to calculate a knight's distance to any given point on a chess board given its initial position.

While the project itself is simple, I wanted to experiment with a couple of topics and technologies not covered in my classes yet which include
* Graph traversal algorithms (Specifically BFS)
* SpringBoot REST API's
* React DND Library

Below I will show some screenshots of what this project looks like when run on a local machine until the deployment of this project is finished
